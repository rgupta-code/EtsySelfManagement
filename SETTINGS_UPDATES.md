## Visual Improvements

### Watermark Preview
- **Before**: Single watermark in one corner
- **After**: Repeated diagonal watermark pattern across entire preview area with rotation

### Collage Preview
- **Before**: Simple icon with text description
- **After**: Detailed layout-specific preview showing exactly 10 image placeholders arranged according to the selected layout style

## Technical Details

### Watermark Rendering
- Uses CSS `transform: rotate()` for angle application
- Creates DOM elements dynamically for each watermark instance
- Calculates grid positions based on container dimensions
- Applies opacity and font size consistently across all instances

### Collage Layout Previews
- **Grid**: 3×3 Tailwind CSS grid with gap spacing
- **Mosaic**: Complex grid with `col-span` and `row-span` for irregular layout
- **Featured**: Combination of large featured area and thumbnail grid
- All layouts use Font Awesome icons for visual consistency

### Backend Compatibility
- Updated `convertSettingsForBackend()` to handle angle conversion
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing backend watermark service
- Angle is passed as integer degrees to backend processing

## Files Modified
- `client/settings.html` - UI structure changes
- `client/js/settings.js` - Complete logic updates
- `client/js/upload.js` - Backend conversion updates

The settings interface is now cleaner, more focused, and provides much better visual feedback for both watermark and collage configuration.
